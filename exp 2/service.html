        <li>Service Centers:

            Ducati has authorized service centers located in various regions. These centers are equipped with specialized tools and trained technicians to provide maintenance and repair services for Ducati vehicles.
            Customers are encouraged to schedule regular maintenance appointments to ensure their vehicles remain in optimal condition.</li>
        <li>Routine Maintenance:

            Regular maintenance is crucial to keep a Ducati running smoothly. This includes oil changes, brake inspections, tire rotations, and other routine checks specified in the vehicle's maintenance schedule.</li>
        <li>Diagnostic Services:

            BMW service centers use advanced diagnostic equipment to identify and address any issues with the vehicle's performance.
            Technicians can read error codes from the vehicle's computer system and perform thorough diagnostics to pinpoint potential problems.</li>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;color: white;">Services You Need To know</h2>
    <ul style="color: white;">
        <li>The enjoyment of riding, reliability and maximum containment of maintenance costs are among the main criteria that drive every engineering project in Ducati. We have spread out services to intervals of 24,000 km (15,000 miles) and on some models the main Desmo Service is not necessary until 30,000 km (18,000 miles). Even the simplest services, the Oil Service, have been spaced out to 12,000 km (7,500 miles) or 15,000 km (9,000 miles), values that represent an absolute reference for high performance engines.</li>
        <li>Remember that the documentation supplied with your bike contains a lot of useful information: from the specific colour code, to advice on winter care, or details about key maintenance.</li>
